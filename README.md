## Research Aim
We aim to investigate the impact of sediments and nutrients on the water quality in the GBR region and find out the temporal and spatial variability of sediments and nutrients in the water by using eReef Hydrodynamic - BioGeoChemical modelling. We use Mackay as the specific study area in the GBR to research its water quality. Data are collected from 3 sites along the same latitude in the time period of 2015 - 2016 (daily) for the temporal and spatial variability assessments.

## Summary of the annlysis
The 4 kilometer grid size hydrodynamic model was used in this research and temperature was selected as the variable to look into the temporal trends of the impact on the water quality. For the biogeochemical model, we used the Baseline catchment scenario (q3b) and selected the following variables. PAR (photosynthetically available radiation) and Secchi (the depth that a Secchi disk is visible from the sea surface) were chosen to reflect the turbidity of the waters as indicators to eutrophication. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and chlorophyll concentration were selected to represent the impacts of nutrients. Total suspended solids (TSS) was a measure of the impacts of sediments on the water quality.

To demonstrate the spatial and temporal variability among the three sites over the year, line charts were created for the variables. Then the temporal variability of water quality in the Mackay area was investigated by comparing the distribution of variables by using maps. At last, the relationships between water quality and nutrients and sediments were revealed by the correlations between PAR / Secchi and other three variables.
